1. Create class that inherits from Projectile.
	- override its move function to change how it moves after being fired.  (Timers may be useful to help it do stuff, or use an int to delay it
	  if necessary)
2. In Projectile.cs, add an id in the ProjectileType enum that can be used to identify the new projectile you created.
3. In the EnemyBuilder class, add a string that can be used to identify the projectile type in the config file to the GetProjectileType() func.
4. In the Enemy class, add a case for the projectileType in the SetProjectileTexture() function
